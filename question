1. I had a confusion in text based captcha . Can u tell me the advanteges of text based captcha overr image based captcha.

The text-based CAPTCHA is the most
deployed CAPTCHA. The security of them can be increased
by adding different font faces, noise and so on. However,
compared with other CAPTCHAs, these schemes require more
complex operation, and many of them are no longer safe. 

The image-based CAPTCHA is the most diverse type.
Easy operation is the advantage of image-based CAPTCHAs. (any person can easily use image based captcha).
Although some image-based CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to
deep learning attacks, it still has a large development space.



ans: text based captcha is the most deployed captcha. most of the internet based companies uses text captcha.
day by day, the security of text based captcha is increasing by adding diff font faces, adding more noise and so on.
However, compared with other captchas, these schemes , require more comlex operations and most of them are no longer safe.
Image based captcha is the most diverse type, the main advanatge of image based captcha is that it can be easily
operateted (any person can easily solve image based captcha).. some of the image based captcha are vulnerable to
deep leaning attacks.
in terms of security, image based captcha >> text based captcha.
in terms of usabilty, image captcha >> text captcha.


2. Can u tell me is there any method to bypass text based captcha.

so  there are mainly three steps to bypass text capctha
1. image preprocessing on the text image. 
2. segmentation
3. OCR

1. image preprocessing on the text image. (reduce noise)
2. segmentation 
done before text recogination because if we skip this part, it will affect the perfomance of character recogintion.(OCR)
basicaly it simplifies the image to get segmentation by detecting their boundaies likes lines or curves.

3. OCR converts that image into machine encoded text.
