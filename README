captcha
=======

INTRODUCTION
1. captcha is a software for generating codes that are easy for humans to pass but difficult for 
computer programs such as BOTS.

(talk: for ex, the human user can extract the distorted text from the given image but bots/computer 
programs in 90's couldn't perform such difficult task)


2. captcha is a simple process, where the user is prompted with automated system-generated question
and the system has to classify between humand and a bot based upon the answer from the user.

(talk: in the further presentation, we will talk about types of captcha questions such as
picture object detection, puzzel solving, speech recognition, text recognition etc.
here text recognition based captcha is mostly used in many of the internet-based services because it is
cost effective and it does not require a database.)


3. captcha (completely automated public turing test to tell computers and human apart) was developed 
in 1997 by Andrei Broder to distinguish between human and computer.

(talk: what is turing test? turing test is a test where the object which distinguish between human and bot
is a human and not a system or software. That's why captcha is known as reverse turing test because the object 
is now captcha system.)



IDEA / WHY? CAPTCHA
1. captcha is a unique security measure to protect the internet-based services from exploitations
performed automatically by millions of bots with offensive intentions.

2. Most of internet based services such as Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail were getting attacked by malicious bots
which used to fill registration forms in these websites automatically with unfitting information 
which further resulted in the performance of the systems and in some cases system failure was caused. 

3. AltaVista attacked by malicious internet bots in 1997.
(talk : ex AltaVista was a very popular search engine in 1997, where users could add url to there database.
AltaVista was the first company to implement captcha to prevent against malicious internet bots that used
to spam urls to their database.)


APPLICATIONS / WHERE? CAPTCHA
1. Website Registration: captcha systems are used in  most of the email-services such as gmail,
yahoo, outlook etc to prevent against bots that used to register thousands of accounts.

2. Search Engine Bots: captcha can be used by administrators to stop search engine bots from indexing 
to prevent others from reading or downloading these sites because they may contain private information.
